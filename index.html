            <p>Hello! I'm a passionate and results-driven developer with a strong interest in building clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications.</p>

            <p>I specialize in front-end and back-end development, with experience in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and more. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive designs.</p>

            <p>I thrive in collaborative environments and continuously seek to learn and grow as a developer. Whether it's improving website performance, writing clean code, or learning a new framework, I’m always up for a challenge.</p>

            <p>When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring tech blogs, contributing to open source, or working on side projects that spark my curiosity.</p>

        <h5>HOBBY </h5>
        <p>
            I have a deep passion for creative arts, especially craftwork, drawing, painting, and jewellery making. 
            These hobbies allow me to express my imagination, relax my mind, and bring beautiful ideas to life with my hands.
             Whether it’s sketching a design, experimenting with colors, or creating handmade accessories,
              I find joy in every step of the creative process.
        </p>
